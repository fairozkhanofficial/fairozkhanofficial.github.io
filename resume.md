## PROJECTS

### Fruit Image Classifier with CNNs (IIT Mandi - CCE) — 09/2025  
**Tech:** Python, PyTorch, Gradio, CLIP, VGG16, ResNet-50, Fruits360  
Built and evaluated custom CNNs alongside VGG16 and ResNet-50 with advanced augmentation and a zero-shot CLIP baseline to classify Fruits360 images. Led dataset preprocessing and class consolidation into nine balanced categories; set up consistent evaluation and a Gradio demo for real-time inference. Delivered improved class balance and generalization with a practical prediction app, demonstrating feasibility for automated sorting and quality control.

### Healthcare-Based NLP Automated Data Cleaning — 02/2025  
**Tech:** Python, spaCy, NLTK, Gensim, Random Forest, Naive Bayes, SQL, NoSQL, Dash/Power BI  
Engineered an NLP pipeline to cleanse and standardize EHRs across structured and unstructured sources, reducing noise and harmonizing medical entities. Applied robust preprocessing (tokenization, normalization), NER to extract clinical entities, and classifiers (Random Forest, Naive Bayes) to categorize and validate records. Implemented data quality KPIs (accuracy, completeness, consistency) and dashboards to monitor improvements and support analytics workflows.

### Medicine Recommendation System — 07/2024  
**Tech:** Python, scikit-learn, Flask, Pandas, HTML/CSS  
Built a symptom-driven ML engine to predict likely conditions and recommend medicines and workout routines, emphasizing safe defaults and clear disclaimers. Developed a Flask web app with a clean UI to collect inputs and serve predictions securely, enabling fast prototyping and stakeholder feedback. Established data handling protocols for privacy and confidentiality.
